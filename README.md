My repository on Deep Learning showcases hands-on projects and experiments that explore the fundamentals and advanced applications of neural networks. It includes implementations of feedforward, convolutional, and recurrent neural networks using TensorFlow and Keras. Each notebook demonstrates practical workflows, such as data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results. The repository also covers topics like activation functions, optimization techniques, regularization, and hyperparameter tuning. By integrating real-world datasets, it bridges theory and practice, offering an educational resource for learners and practitioners. This collection reflects my passion for artificial intelligence and continuous learning in the deep learning domain.
